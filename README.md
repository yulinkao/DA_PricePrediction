# Big Data Project: Cook County Property Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains all materials related to our big data project aimed at predicting property values in Cook County, Illinois. The project applies data analytics techniques to assess properties fairly and accurately using historical data and R programming.

## Repository Contents
- **Code (Code.html)**: Contains the complete code and detailed explanations for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling to predict property values.

## Project Background
The project is based on a property assessment challenge for Cook County, Illinois. It involves using property data from the Cook County Assessorâ€™s Office (CCAO) to develop a predictive model for property values. The CCAO is responsible for assessing the fair market value of properties within the county, which includes the City of Chicago and over 130 other municipalities.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data to find patterns and insights.
3. **Model Building**: Using regression and other statistical techniques to predict property values.
4. **Validation**: Assessing the accuracy and reliability of the models.

## Data
The analysis is performed using the `historic_property_data.csv` for historical property sales and `predict_property_data.csv` for the properties to assess.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R Programming**: All analysis is conducted using R.
- **Libraries**: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, corrplot, and other R packages.
